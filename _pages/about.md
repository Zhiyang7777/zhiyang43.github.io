I am a Postdoc Scholar in [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD, advised by Prof. [Yusu Wang](http://yusu.belkin-wang.org/).

I earned my PhD in the [Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in May 2025, having the honor to be advised by Prof. [Alejandro Ribeiro](https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/). I received B.E. and M.E. degrees in 2016 and 2019, respectively, advised by Prof. [Cong Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/cong-shen), from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
